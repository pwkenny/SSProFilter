The software has been built using the OEChem toolkit so you'll need an OpenEye license to use it.  

Source is in ssprofilter.1.0.cpp

You'll need to edit a couple of things in the make_ssprofilter and these are indicated with comments.

Some documentation is available in ssprofilter.documentation.pdf
